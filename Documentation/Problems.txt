Working in Linux environment.
Using Ubuntu Bionic Beaver (development branch) 18.04
Currently facing many problems as I'm not a developer or anyone near.
Anyway this environment is so relaxing but not so user friendly.
These changes are made via "Atom Editor".
Atom contains git functions.
Using git via atom editor is far better and easy to push or pull or commit.
I would like to recommend you all to start using atom if you are seeing my document.
I hope it's helpfull.
